A text based battle game

This is a basic text-based game, where the user inputs various commands in order to complete battles,
buy items and make further progress. The aim is to earn enough money to afford all the available weapons
in the shop, after which point it should be possible to easily defeat all enemies in combat. There are
ten types of enemy in total. The most difficult enemies are encountered less often on the battlefield.
Some are extremely rare.

Made in a day.
